## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Marketing Data set**

This repository contains Python and SQL scripts to perform data analysis and visualization using Power BI. The pipeline consists of the following steps:

### Step 1: Read Data in Python

- Use Python to read the relevant datasets and load them into memory for further processing.

### Step 2: Data Cleansing and Transformation

- Perform data cleansing and transformation tasks in Python to ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis.

### Step 3: Merge Datasets in Python

- Combine and merge dataset 1 and dataset 2 into a single unified dataset using Python.

### Step 4: Connect Python and MySQL

- Set up a connection between Python and MySQL to facilitate data transfer between the two platforms.

### Step 5: Send Data to MySQL

- Transfer the merged dataset from Python to MySQL for storage and further processing.

### Step 6: Data Grouping and Views in SQL

- Apply data grouping and create views in MySQL to organize and simplify the data for analysis.

### Step 7: Connect SQL and Power BI

- Connect SQL and Power BI using the ODBC connector to enable smooth data access.

### Step 8: Data Visualization in Power BI

- Utilize Power BI to create insightful visualizations and reports based on the processed data.

Feel free to explore the scripts in the repository to understand the implementation of each step in detail. For any questions or issues, please don't hesitate to open an issue or contact the repository owners.

Happy data analysis and visualization!
